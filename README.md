<h1>Description</h1>
<p>This was a Refactoring assignment; focusing on the HTML elements and changing them into semantic HTML.</P>

<h2>Skills I learned:<h2>
<div>
  <ul>
    <li>Learned to not overthink the instructions and read carefully.</li>
    <li>Learned the basic components of a semantic HTML structure.</li>
    <li>Learned to look at my code patiently and break it down to find errors.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p>For this particular project, I found motivation by wanting to understand code better and to finish the assingment on time for m course.</p>
